# Rave Saber

Rave Saber is an open source, open hardware lightsaber build. Unlike most
sabers, which focus on mainly on sound playback - we focus heavily on the
visual effects. Rave sabers are meant to be swung around to the beat of some
loud music :)

Rave Saber uses DotStar LEDs driven with an Atmel ATmega168a AVR
microcontroller.

## Releases

The Hardware & Firmware releases are kept in lockstep - v1 of the firmware
should be used with v1 of the hardware.

### v1.0.0

* [Hardware v1.0.0][hw1.0.0]
* [Firmware v1.0.0][fw1.0.0]

This is pretty much the simplest possible design we could make. It's meant for
prototyping & testing - not for use in a hilt. The hardware is assembled using
a breadboard & powered via a bench power supply, and the firmware allows for
switching between various blade colors.
